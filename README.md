This is my first practice project using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android development. I'm still learning, so some parts of the app might not work perfectly or follow best practices.

The main goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with:

Kotlin syntax

Building UI with Jetpack Compose

Basic Android app structure


Any feedback is welcome!
